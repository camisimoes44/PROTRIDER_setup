# PROTRIDER Setup

This repository contains scripts and configurations to prepare proteomics quantification data (from MaxQuant output) as input for [PROTRIDER](https://github.com/gagneurlab/PROTRIDER), a tool for detecting protein expression outliers.

## üîç Workflow Overview

1. **Input files** (place them inside the `data/` folder):
   - `proteinGroups.txt`: main MaxQuant output with protein intensities (tab-separated `.txt`)
   - `mapping_table.tsv`: a two-column file mapping intensity column names to sample names.

2. **Processing steps**:
   - Selection of reporter intensity columns corresponding to real biological samples
   - Exclusion of control channels (e.g., HEK standard in channel 11)
   - Removal of samples with known issues (e.g., poor TMT labeling)
   - Renaming columns to reflect actual sample names
   - Generation of `quant_input.csv` as input for PROTRIDER
   - *(Optional)* generation of `covariates.csv` with metadata (e.g., batch, sample group)

3. **Output files** (saved under the `output/` directory):
   - `quant_input.tsv`: input matrix for PROTRIDER (proteins √ó samples, tab-separated)
   - `covariates.csv`: *(optional)* metadata for samples (batch, sex, etc.)
   - `config.yaml`: configuration file for running PROTRIDER
